This will be how we collaborate on this project

We will be using Github Desktop, which each of your should have installed.


I have made a branch for each of you with your names on it. 
#### Make sure this is the only branch you commit to!

Commit smaller changes to your branch often. Not only is it a log of what you have done, but it is something to look back to if something goes wrong or gets deleted. You can always revert what you have committed.

Dont forget to occasionally sync with Github servers by pressing the top right button that either reads Fetch, Push, or Pull Origin. Do this before and after you work on it.

When you think your changes are stable (they work or at least dont cause errors) and want to share with the rest of the group, follow these steps.

1. Make sure all of your changes are committed on your branch
1. Sync once more to be sure
1. Change the Branch you are working on to "Main"
1. Under the "Branch" tab at the top bar of Github Desktop, Select "Rebase current branch"
1. Select your Branch, then click "Start Rebase"
1. Assuming you have followed these steps, you can click "yes" or "confirm" on all the warnings.
1. Sync again, it will warn you, do it anyways.
